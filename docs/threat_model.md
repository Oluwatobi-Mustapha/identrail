# Threat Model

Simple threat list for current system.

## 1) Overlapping Scan Runs
- Threat: Two scans write at same time and cause inconsistent results.
- Fix: Single-flight lock per provider (`scan:<provider>`).
- Status: Implemented.

## 2) Duplicate Data on Rerun
- Threat: Re-running same flow keeps inserting duplicates.
- Fix: Upsert keys for raw assets, identities, policies, relationships, permissions, findings.
- Status: Implemented.

## 3) Broad Trust + Broad Permission Escalation
- Threat: External principal can assume role with admin-like permissions.
- Fix: Risk engine rule for escalation path and risky trust findings.
- Status: Implemented.

## 4) API Trigger Abuse
- Threat: Repeated scan trigger calls can overload service.
- Fix: Single-flight lock and API conflict response for in-flight run.
- Status: Implemented.

## 5) Unbounded List Queries
- Threat: Very high `limit` may cause performance issues.
- Fix: Clamp API `limit` with max cap.
- Status: Implemented.

## 6) Missing Security Response Headers
- Threat: Weak default API hardening.
- Fix: Add API security headers middleware.
- Status: Implemented.

## 7) Unauthenticated API Access
- Threat: Anyone can trigger scans or read findings.
- Fix: API key authentication for `/v1/*` endpoints.
- Status: Implemented.

## 8) Excessive Request Flood
- Threat: Repeated requests can degrade API availability.
- Fix: Per-IP rate limiter.
- Status: Implemented.

## 9) Misconfigured Database Connection Pool
- Threat: Too many DB connections or long-lived bad connections.
- Fix: Set safe Postgres pool defaults.
- Status: Implemented.

## 10) Schema Drift on Startup
- Threat: Service starts on old schema and fails at runtime.
- Fix: Startup migration runner for Postgres mode.
- Status: Implemented.

## Current Gaps (Next)
- Add API authorization model (not only API key auth).
- Add audit log stream for access and scan triggers.
- Add secret encryption policy and key management guide.
