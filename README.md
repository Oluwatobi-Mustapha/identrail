# Identrail

Identrail is a machine identity security platform.

It discovers machine and workload identities across cloud environments, maps who can assume what, analyzes privilege paths, and surfaces security findings such as overprivileged, stale, risky, or ownerless identities.

Initial focus is AWS, with architecture hooks for Kubernetes and Azure.

The goal is simple: give security and IAM teams clear visibility and actionable risk insights before identity issues become incidents.

## Current CLI

- `identrail scan`: run the AWS phase-1 scanner pipeline (fixture-backed)
- `identrail findings`: view findings from the latest saved scan state
